# simpleNN
Just a simple NN using MNIST Database

Very messy converting to a OOP style. Doesn't exactly give the desired results, I think some of the backpropagation math is incorrect however it does work to some degree. It seems to never identify certain numbers correctly, however that might be because of the training size I gave it.
